- 👋 Hi, I’m @crismdq22
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering complete systems, be it frontend (React), backend (.Net Core, Spring & Express), 
working with data science tools (Pandas, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow) and expanding my knowledge in DevOps tooling (currently using GitHub Actions, but want to learn IaC tools).
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in all the afromentioned things, trying to be as flexible as possible, while keeping the fundamentals as the core of my continuous education.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Open Source Project with a meaning, something that might be useful for people some day, especially true for things related to medicine.
